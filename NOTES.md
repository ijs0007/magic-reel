# Magic Reel — handoff notes

## Phase 1 (2026-06-26) — switcher + accent. Mechanical pass. Review & push when ready.

### 1A · Two-way switcher
- Added **Credits** as a destination in the app switcher (`public/studio.html`, the only page with the switcher nav). Inserted a `&middot;` dot + `<a href="https://credits.isaiahsmithfilms.com" data-app="credits">Credits</a>` after Marquee, matching the existing entry shape exactly.
- No JS change needed: the existing hostname-aware lighting snippet only marks the *current* app active, and Reel is never served on the credits host, so Credits renders as a normal link — same as the other non-active entries.

### 1B · Accent reassigned: purple → **orange `#f45911`**
Reel had no accent picker — purple was its hardcoded suite identity. Changed every identity instance to orange; left non-identity color data alone.

Changed:
- `public/dashboard.html`, `index.html`, `reel.html`, `studio.html` — each `:root` light + `body.dark` `--accent` (purple → `#f45911`), and the wordmark title gradient `--t1/--t2/--t3` (`#9a78ff/#7c4dff/#c77dff` → `#ff8a3d/#f45911/#ffb74d`).
- `public/reel.html` — `.greet .ava` default avatar background (was the brand purple) → orange, to stay on-brand.
- `server.js` — recipient-page `:root --accent` and the "Open your reel" email button background → orange.
- `server.js` `APP_VERSION` bumped `v0.10.8` → `v0.11.0`.

**Left unchanged on purpose (assumption — confirm if you disagree):**
- The `AVA=[...]` avatar palette in `dashboard.html` and `index.html` starts with `#7c4dff`. That array is a *categorical 8-color wheel* assigning distinct colors to different people, not the brand accent, so I left it. If you'd rather its first slot match the new orange, say so.

### Orange gradient choice
For the wordmark gradient I derived `#ff8a3d / #f45911 / #ffb74d` (light → base → light) since there was no existing orange gradient at `#f45911`. Easy to tweak if you want a different feel.

### Validation
- `node --check server.js` ✅
- Switcher: 1 Credits entry, nav tags balanced ✅
- No deploy — yours to push.
